<h2 class="color">What is the Purpose of <span class="italicize">Copyright?</span></h2>

<p class="color">Imagine how it would feel, if you worked incredibly hard on something, just to have someone claim it as their own. That is why copyright is a thing, so people can create their own original work without the threat of having it stolen. Copyright is especially important for web designers, as they have to know what they can and can't use.</p>

<h2 class="color">Copyright Scavenger Hunt</h2>

<h3 class="color">Answer Key</h3>

<ol class="color">
  <li><a href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/what-is-fair-use/"><span class="list">Question 1:</span></a> What is the definition of fair use?<br> Fair use is any copying of copyrighted material done for many purposes, such as to comment on, criticize, or parody without the permission from the copyright owner.</li>
  <li><a href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/"><span class="list">Question 2:</span></a> What is a public domain?<br> A public domain is the creative materials that are not protected by intellectual property laws, such as copyright, trademark, or any other patent laws. It is owned by the public, and not any single individual.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.lib.purdue.edu/uco/CopyrightBasics/penalties.html"><span class="list">Question 3:</span></a> What are the punishments for violating copyright laws?<br> The infringer may have to pay the dollar amount of damages or profits, pay $200 - $150,000 for work infringed, pay for all court and attorney fees, the infringer can go to jail, and many others.</li>
  <li><a href="https://libguides.bhtafe.edu.au/c.php?g=762808&p=5470102"><span class="list">Question 4:</span></a> How do you properly cite a quote from a source?<br> If you are quoting someone word-for-word, or quoting someone elses idea, you need to reference it within your work, by working the author's surname or the organisation's name, the year of publication, and the page number into whatever you are writing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://creativefuture.org/video-game-streaming/"><span class="list">Question 5:</span></a> What are some copyright rules for streaming video game play?<br> Game developers and publishers legally own the rights to use of their game, which means they can limit and control how their video is being broadcasted. Developers have the ability to file takedown notices aiming at any of their material, and they have the right to deny the ability to stream a game. You also have to take notice to music, as any copyrighted music can have your stream taken down.</li>
