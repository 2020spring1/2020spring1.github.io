	<h2>Tone
	</h2>
	<p>When your writing an email, you have to be very careful with the tone of your words. You aren't talking tot his person face-to-face, so you may read something one way, and the person you are sending it to could interepate it very differently. After you write something in an email, you should read it over many times, as if you are the one receiving the email. You just have to remember, <span class="span">different people interperate things very differently</span>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Content
	</h2>
	<p>I think it can be agreed upon by all, that nobody wants to waste ther time reading an email that just keeps going on and on. Like they say in math class, you have to be precise and concise. Only say what you need to say. Don't try to add any filler, as that will just make the reader uninteresting, and there will be less of a chance that they actually pay attention to what you are trying to tell them.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Structure
	</h2>
	<p>One of the most important things about writing an email, is that it is structured well. You want to structure it, like you're writing an important letter that could make or break something for you. You start with the person's name on the first line, followed by an enter. After that, always start each new paragraph by indenting it. Once your done writing that part, use a word like, “sincerely”, or “thank you”, use a comma, hit enter, then put your name, and you've written your email.
